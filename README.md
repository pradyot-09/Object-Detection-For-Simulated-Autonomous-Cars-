Research on : Object Detection For Simulated Autonomous Cars 

- ABSTRACT

Artificial Intelligence has evolved through the years to have applications in new domains such as object detection for autonomous cars. The accuracy required by these domains often exceeds the accuracy provided by traditional neural net models. An emerging alternative for training self driving cars can be provided by a modified leNet model . The aim of this paper is to provide a modified leNet model to further increase the accuracy. The succeeding topics explore the proposed solution to build, train, and test our modified leNet model and use it to simulate self driving car and incorporate object detection to get a better simulation of real time traffic scenarios.
